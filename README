This file contains information about how to compile the program (Section A), 
then how to run the program for regular access to Nile.com (Section B).
Regular access will prompt for user-inputted queries to Nile.com, which must
match a certain format, which is described next (Section C). Lastly, 
this file contains information about how to run tests on the code to find 
the time it takes to process buy or lookup requests (Section D).

                         A. COMPILING THE PROGRAM


To compile, type "make". It will put all .class files in the bin folder.
When running the program, make sure you are running from the bin folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          B. RUNNING THE PROGRAM


Run the following programs in different terminal windows or on different 
machines, in the following manner:

	1. Catalog Server

			java Catalog

	2. Order Server

			java Order [catalogHost]

		If you are not running this server on the same machine as the
		Catalog server, you will need to provide the host of the 
		Catalog server. For example:

			java Order 12.345.67.890

		If no host is specified, the default is "localhost".

	3. java FrontEndServer

			java FrontEndServer [catalogHost] [orderHost]

		If you are not running this server on the same machine as the Order
		and Catalog servers, you need to specify the host of both the 
		Order and Catalog servers. If no hosts are specified, the default 
		is "localhost" for both. Ex:

			java FrontEndServer 12.345.67.890 24.6.813.579

	4. java Client

			java Client [fronEndServerHost]

		If this server is not run on the same machine as the Front-End 
		server, a host must be specified. If no host is specified, the 
		default is "localhost". Ex:

			java Client 987.65.43.210

		(See Section D for other ways of running the Client server.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      C. USER INPUT QUERY FORMAT


Once the program is running, requests must be entered into the machine
running the Client program in a certain format. There are a number of
possible requests:

	1. Search for a topic
		Returns all entries that match the topic specified, the form 
		of a book title and the book item number. 

		search [topic]

	2. Book Lookup
		Searches for specified book item number and returns the title, 
		the number of books in stock, and the cost of the book.

		lookup [itemNo]

	3. Buy
		Places an order for the book that matches the specified item 
		number.

		buy [itemNo]

List of available topics for catalog:
	- 'distributed systems'
	- 'college life'

Item Numbers available: 
	- 57471
	- 58574
	- 12395
	- 13298

            D. RUNNIING THE PROGRAM FOR TIMED REQUEST TESTS

The code is built to run timed buy queries and lookup queries, 500 times.
The user can specify the query type and whether the queries should be 
independent and intensive queries or concurrent queries. 

INPUT:
	java Client [orderHost] [queryType] [requestType]


	1. orderHost

		The same as described in Section B, this should be the host of the
		Order server. It must be specified in this case and will not default
		to "localhost" if you pass in other parameters. However, "localhost" is
		still a valid option.

	2. queryType

		- "ui" for user-input queries as regularly done in Section B

		- "iq" for independent queries

			The independent query option will make 500 separate requests to
			the server.

		- "cq" for concurrent queries

			The concurrent query option will make 500 concurrent requests through
			500 sepearte threads to the server.

	3. requestType

		- "b" for buy requests

			The request type will be 'buy'.

		- "l" for lookup requests

			The request type will be 'lookup'.

		- Default is buy request if no type is given


OUTPUT:
	Intensive Queries:
		All intensive queries compute the total time it takes for 500 individual
		requests, of type buy or lookup according to user input, and then 
		computes the average time. This average time is outputted to the terminal:

		Ex: 
			$ java Client localhost iq b
			Bound the frontendserver!
			Buy requests on Intensive Queries: 
			Timing 500 queries, beginning with lookUps
			BUY AVG TIME: 1838582 nanoseconds

	Concurrent Queries:
		Concurrent queries also compute the total time it takes to execute one
		request (of type user-input), and then each separate query will print to
		the terminal the time it took for that request.

		Ex:
			$ java Client localhost cq b
			Bound the frontendserver!
			Buy requests on Concurrent Queries: 
			19091000
			20003000
			... etc.
